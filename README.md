###ArguMentor

Hello! We are ArguMentor, and our application productively challenges your arguments rather than agreeing with them. 

We believe that most LLMs are too agreeable, which is nice but not incredibly conducive to all use cases. That's where ArguMentor steps in - our application actively debates with you over your ideas to highlight flaws and weaknesses in your argument. 

We see our application functioning primarily in the education space - whether being used to prepare for thesis defenses, research panels, or class discussions, our application provides users with questions that challenge ideas and provoke more critical thought. 

Our application provides users with agents that can portray different scenarios, enabling users to find a customized scenario for their situation. A researcher preparing for a research panel might use our application to simulate a Q&A session to prepare for questions that might be asked. A PhD student might use our application to get ready to defend their thesis. Even in everyday scenarios, our application can be useful for simulating discussions involving multiple viewpoints to providing counterarguments for an essay.
