# ArguMentor

Hello! We are **ArguMentor**, and our application *productively challenges your arguments rather than agreeing with them*. 

We believe that most LLMs are too agreeable, which is nice but not incredibly conducive to all use cases. That's where ArguMentor steps in - our application actively debates with you over your ideas to highlight flaws and weaknesses in your argument. 

We see our application functioning primarily in the education space - whether being used to prepare for thesis defenses, research panels, or class discussions, our application provides users with questions that challenge ideas and provoke more critical thought. 

# Educational Use Cases 

Our application provides users with agents that can portray different scenarios, enabling users to find a customized scenario for their situation. 

- A researcher preparing for a research panel might use our application to simulate a Q&A session to prepare for questions that might be asked
- A PhD student might use our application to get ready to defend their thesis
- Even in everyday scenarios, our application can be useful for simulating discussions involving multiple viewpoints to providing counterarguments for an essay.

If you're looking for something even more custom, you have the ability to even create custom agents yourself!

# How to Use

First, choose an agent that you want to simulate a situation with. After, input information about your situation - i.e. if the situation is a research fair, a class discussion, etc. Then, sit back and let our platform work its magic!  

# Resources Used

We fine-tuned our LLM to reflect more critical thinking with an Anthropic dataset using Together.ai. Additionally, we created a second model that was fine-tuned using Monster API. Our front-end was modeled off of a Convex template and our backend is also powered by Convex.
